#Abstract
In this program I use the Runga-Kutta method to calculate the angle in phase with the frequency of the driving force after the transient period.Then I change the frequency for observation of the angle an find that the curves in the phase space are still similar. In the last part I plot the bifurcation diagram and a magnified version, and find the transition value of FD and calculate the first two value of the Feigenbaum delta in this system.

#Background
In last week's assignment we construct the chaos phenomenon by the method of phase space, this week we take the route to chaos by period doubling. As we change the strength of the driving force the periodic evolution of the angle doubles, so we can observe at certain points of the time. In this way, we can plot a bifurcation diagram and calculate the Feigenbaum constant.
