#### Exercise 3.12
In constructing the Poincaré section in Figure 3.9 we plotted points only at times that were in phase with the drive force; that is, at times <img src="https://github.com/ACGNnsj/compuational_physics_N2014301020001/blob/master/Excercise_07/CodeCogsEqn.gif?raw=true" alt="" title="" />, where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n" alt="" title="" /> is an integer. At these values of <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t" alt="" title="" /> the driving force passed through zero [see(3.18)]. However, we could jusi as easily have chosen to make the plot at times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force, or at times <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi/4" alt="" title="" /> out-of-phase with this force, etc. Construct the Poincaré sections for these cases and compare them with Figure 3.9.

#### Exercise 3.13
Write a program to calculate and compare the behavior of two, nearly identical pendulums. Use it to calculate the divergence of two nearby trajectories in the chaotic regime, as in Figure 3.7, and make a qualitative estimate of the corresponding Lyapunov exponent from the slope of a plot of  as a function of .
