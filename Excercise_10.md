* **EXERCISES**

4.9. In this section we saw that orbits are unstable for any value of <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta" alt="" title="" /> that is not precisely 2 in (4.12). A related question, which we did not address (until now), is how unstable an orbit might be. That is, how long will it take for an unstable orbit to become obvious. The answer to this question depends on the nature of the orbit. If the intial velocity is chosen so as to make the orbit precisely circular, then the value of <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta" alt="" title="" /> in (4.12) will make absolutely no difference. Of course, in practice it is impossible to construct an orbit that is exactly circular, so the instabilities when <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta\neq2" alt="" title="" /> will always be apparent given enough time. Even so, orbits that start out as nearly circular will remain almost stable for a longer period than those that are highly elliptical. Investigate this by studying orbits with the same value of <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta" alt="" title="" /> (say, <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta=2.05" alt="" title="" /> and comparing the behavior with different values of the ellipticity of the orbit. You should find that the orientation of orbits that are more nearly circular will rotate more slowly than those that are highly elliptical.

4.11. Investigate how the precession of the perihelion of a planet's orbit due to general relativity varies as a function of the eccentricity of the orbit. Study the precession of different elliptical orbits with different eccentricities, but with the same value of the perihelion. Let the perihelion have the same value as for Mercury, so that you can compare it with the results shown in this section.

* **伯特兰定理**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;在经典力学里，伯特兰定理阐明，只有两种位势<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V" alt="" title="" />可以给出闭合轨道：

①平方反比有心力给出的连心势，像引力势或静电势，以方程表示为

</div>

②径向谐振子势：

</div>

其中， r是径向坐标， k是正值常数。假若物体从某位置移动，经过一段路径后，又回到原先位置，则称此路径为闭合轨道。

这两种情况分别对应β=2和β=-1
